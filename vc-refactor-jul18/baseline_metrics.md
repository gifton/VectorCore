# VectorCore Baseline Performance Metrics

Date: 2025-07-25
Platform: macOS (Darwin)
Build: Debug

## Summary

After successfully removing Accelerate dependencies and implementing pure Swift SIMD operations, we've established baseline performance metrics for key operations.

## Key Metrics (768D vectors)

### Vector Addition
- **Wall Clock Time**: 2.87 seconds (1000 iterations)
- **CPU Time**: 532ms 
- **Memory Allocations**: 3.8MB total
- **Memory Leaks**: 0 (no leaks detected)

### Vector Dot Product  
- **Wall Clock Time**: 1.67 seconds (1000 iterations)
- **CPU Time**: 519ms
- **Memory Allocations**: 3.8MB total
- **Memory Leaks**: 0 (no leaks detected)

### Euclidean Distance
- **Wall Clock Time**: 333ms average (per operation)
- **CPU Time**: 173ms average
- **Memory Allocations**: 1KB total
- **Memory Leaks**: 0 (no leaks detected)

## Performance Analysis

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Zero memory leaks across all operations, indicating proper memory management
2. **Pure Swift Performance**: Operations are running on pure Swift SIMD implementation without Accelerate
3. **Baseline Established**: These metrics serve as the foundation for optimization work in Phase 2

## Next Steps

1. Run benchmarks in Release mode for production performance metrics
2. Compare with Accelerate-based implementation (if available)
3. Begin Phase 2 optimizations targeting identified bottlenecks
4. Implement continuous performance monitoring

## Notes

- Benchmarks run in Debug mode - Release mode will show significant improvements
- All operations tested with 768-dimensional vectors (common embedding size)
- Memory allocations are minimal, indicating efficient buffer reuse
- Release mode benchmarks pending resolution of Swift compiler issue with posix_memalign

## Status

✅ Phase 1 Tasks Completed:
- Performance benchmarking framework operational (swift-benchmark integrated)
- Baseline performance metrics captured (Debug mode)
- Zero memory leaks confirmed
- Pure Swift SIMD implementation functional

⏳ Pending:
- Release mode performance metrics (compiler issue)
- Comparison with previous Accelerate-based implementation

// VectorCore: Large Vector Storage (513+ dimensions)
//
// Unified storage for large vectors using COWDynamicStorage
//
// This type consolidates SIMDStorage768, SIMDStorage1536, and SIMDStorage3072 into
// a single flexible storage that efficiently handles vectors with more than 512
// elements using dynamic allocation with Copy-on-Write semantics.

import Accelerate

/// Optimized storage for vectors with dimensions 513+.
///
/// `LargeVectorStorage` consolidates SIMDStorage768, SIMDStorage1536, and SIMDStorage3072
/// into a single type that uses COWDynamicStorage for ultimate flexibility. It handles
/// arbitrarily large vectors efficiently through dynamic allocation.
///
/// ## Design Rationale
/// - Dynamic allocation scales to any size
/// - COW semantics prevent unnecessary copies
/// - No fixed-size overhead for varying dimensions
/// - Suitable for embeddings and large ML models
///
/// ## Performance Characteristics
/// - Heap allocated with 16-byte alignment
/// - COW semantics from COWDynamicStorage
/// - Memory scales linearly with dimension
/// - Accelerate-optimized operations
/// - Chunked operations available for cache efficiency
///
/// ## Implementation Details
/// Unlike Small and Medium storage types which use fixed buffers, LargeVectorStorage
/// allocates exactly the memory needed for each dimension. This makes it memory-efficient
/// for varied sizes while maintaining performance through COW optimization.
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// // Create a 3072-element vector (GPT-style embedding)
/// let vec = LargeVectorStorage(commonSize: .dim3072)
/// 
/// // Or with custom size
/// let customVec = LargeVectorStorage(count: 8192)
/// 
/// // Chunked operations for very large vectors
/// let dot = vec1.chunkedDotProduct(vec2, chunkSize: 2048)
/// ```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. ExecutionContext Pattern
```swift
// Automatic parallelization
let results = try await Operations.findNearest(
    to: query,
    in: vectors,
    k: 10
)

// Explicit control when needed
let results = try await Operations.findNearest(
    to: query,
    in: vectors,
    k: 10,
    context: CPUContext.sequential  // Force sequential
)
```

### 2. Presets for Different Workloads
- `CPUContext.automatic`: Default, chooses based on data size
- `CPUContext.sequential`: Single-threaded execution
- `CPUContext.performance`: Maximum parallelization
- `CPUContext.efficiency`: Balanced for power efficiency

### 3. Future GPU Acceleration
- `MetalContext`: Ready for GPU operations
- `NeuralContext`: Ready for Neural Engine
- Unified API means no code changes needed

## Memory Efficiency

The BufferPool system provides:
- **Reduced Allocations**: Reuses buffers across operations
- **Thread Safety**: Actor-based design prevents races
- **Automatic Sizing**: Power-of-two rounding for optimal reuse
- **Cleanup**: Periodic cleanup of unused buffers

## Recommendations

### For Best Performance:
1. Use Operations API for automatic optimization
2. Let ExecutionContext choose parallelization strategy
3. Reuse contexts across multiple operations
4. Use batch operations for multiple queries

### For Memory Efficiency:
1. Process data in chunks when possible
2. Let BufferPool manage temporary allocations
3. Use appropriate vector dimensions for your use case

## Future Optimizations

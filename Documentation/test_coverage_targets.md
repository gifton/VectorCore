# VectorCore Test Coverage Targets and Metrics

## Overview

This document defines the test coverage targets and quality metrics for the VectorCore refactoring project. It establishes minimum requirements for code coverage, test types, and quality gates for the CI/CD pipeline.

## Coverage Targets

### Overall Coverage Goals

- **Minimum Line Coverage**: 85%
- **Target Line Coverage**: 90%
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100%
- **Branch Coverage**: 80%
- **Function Coverage**: 95%

### Per-Component Targets

| Component | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Core Vector Operations | 95% | 90% | Critical performance paths |
| Storage Layer | 90% | 85% | Memory safety critical |
| Distance Metrics | 95% | 90% | Mathematical correctness |
| Batch Operations | 85% | 80% | Parallelization paths |
| Performance Baseline | 90% | 85% | Regression detection |
| Error Handling | 100% | 95% | All error paths tested |
| Protocol Conformance | 100% | 100% | All protocols validated |

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (60% of tests)
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Characteristics**: Fast, deterministic, no external dependencies
- **Requirements**:
  - Each public API must have unit tests
  - Edge cases must be covered
  - Error conditions must be tested
  - Average execution time < 1ms per test

### 2. Integration Tests (20% of tests)
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions and workflows
- **Characteristics**: Test multiple components together
- **Requirements**:
  - Cover all major workflows
  - Test configuration variations
  - Validate component boundaries
  - Average execution time < 100ms per test

### 3. Property-Based Tests (15% of tests)
- **Purpose**: Verify mathematical properties and invariants
- **Characteristics**: Randomized inputs, property verification
- **Requirements**:
  - 100+ iterations per property
  - Cover all mathematical operations
  - Test invariants and laws
  - Reproducible with seed

### 4. Performance Tests (5% of tests)
- **Purpose**: Prevent performance regressions
- **Characteristics**: Benchmarks, profiling, regression detection
- **Requirements**:
  - Baseline comparison
  - Statistical significance
  - Memory profiling
  - Regression threshold: 5%

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Indicators

1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**
   - Maximum per function: 10
   - Average per file: < 5
   - Action: Refactor if exceeded

2. **Test Maintainability**
   - Test-to-code ratio: 1.5:1 to 2:1
   - Assertion density: 2-5 per test
   - Setup/teardown complexity: Minimal

3. **Test Independence**
   - No shared mutable state
   - Parallel execution safe
   - Order independent

### Test Execution Metrics

1. **Speed**
   - Unit test suite: < 10 seconds
   - Integration tests: < 1 minute
   - Full test suite: < 5 minutes
   - Property tests: < 2 minutes

2. **Reliability**
   - Flakiness rate: < 0.1%
   - Deterministic results
   - Clear failure messages

3. **Coverage Trends**
   - Coverage must not decrease
   - New code requires tests
   - Exemptions documented

## CI/CD Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Run quick tests before commit
swift test --filter ".*Unit.*" --parallel
```

### Pull Request Requirements
- All tests must pass
- Coverage targets met
- No performance regressions
- Property tests pass

### Continuous Integration
```yaml
test-pipeline:
  - unit-tests:
      coverage: true
      parallel: true
      timeout: 10m
  
  - integration-tests:
      coverage: true
      timeout: 15m
  
  - property-tests:
      iterations: 1000
      timeout: 20m
  
  - performance-tests:
      baseline: main
      threshold: 5%
      timeout: 30m
  
  - coverage-report:
      fail-under: 85%
      target: 90%
```

## Coverage Measurement

### Tools
- **Swift**: `swift test --enable-code-coverage`
- **Xcode**: Built-in coverage tools
- **CI**: Coverage reports with trends

### Excluded from Coverage
- Test files themselves
- Generated code
- Debug-only code
- Platform-specific code (documented)

### Coverage Commands

```bash
# Generate coverage report
swift test --enable-code-coverage
xcrun llvm-cov export \
  .build/debug/VectorCorePackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/VectorCorePackageTests \
  -instr-profile .build/debug/codecov/default.profdata \
  -format="lcov" > coverage.lcov

# View coverage locally
xcrun llvm-cov show \
  .build/debug/VectorCorePackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/VectorCorePackageTests \
  -instr-profile .build/debug/codecov/default.profdata
```

## Test Documentation Requirements

### Test Naming Convention
```swift
func test_MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior() {
    // Example: test_normalize_ZeroVector_ThrowsError()
}
```

### Test Documentation
- Each test class must have a header comment
- Complex tests need inline documentation
- Property tests must document the property being tested
- Performance tests must document baseline expectations

## Enforcement and Monitoring

### Automated Checks
1. Coverage gates in CI/CD
2. Complexity analysis in PR reviews
3. Test execution time monitoring
4. Flakiness detection and reporting

### Manual Reviews
1. Test quality in code reviews
2. Coverage of edge cases
3. Property selection appropriateness
4. Performance test relevance

### Reporting
- Weekly coverage trends
- Test execution time trends
- Flakiness reports
- Performance regression alerts

## Continuous Improvement

### Quarterly Reviews
- Adjust coverage targets based on data
- Update performance baselines
- Review and refactor slow tests
- Add new property tests for bugs

### Test Debt Management
- Track untested code
- Prioritize critical paths
- Schedule test improvements
- Document technical debt

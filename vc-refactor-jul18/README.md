# VectorCore Clean Architecture Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide details the complete architectural overhaul of VectorCore, implementing a clean, modern design without any legacy constraints. Since VectorCore is still in development with no released versions, we have complete freedom to create the ideal architecture.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate ~1,000 lines of code duplication** across Vector/DynamicVector, Storage types, and Operations
2. **Create a unified, protocol-based architecture** that maximizes code reuse
3. **Build GPU-ready foundations** with ExecutionContext pattern
4. **Establish performance benchmarks** to ensure no regression
5. **Design a minimal, clean public API** following Swift best practices

## Phase Overview

The implementation is structured in 5 phases, each building on the previous:

### [Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure](Phase1_Foundation.md)
Set up benchmarking, testing, and build infrastructure to ensure quality throughout the refactoring.

### [Phase 2: Core Protocol Architecture](Phase2_Protocols.md)
Design and implement the protocol hierarchy that will unify all vector types.

### [Phase 3: Unified Storage System](Phase3_Storage.md)
Create a single, generic storage implementation optimized for performance.

### [Phase 4: Vector Implementation](Phase4_Vectors.md)
Implement unified Vector and DynamicVector types using the protocol architecture.

### [Phase 5: Modern Operations Layer](Phase5_Operations.md)
Build the ExecutionContext-based operations system ready for CPU and GPU acceleration.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Zero Duplication**: Every piece of logic implemented once
2. **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees where possible
3. **Performance First**: No abstraction overhead
4. **Future Ready**: GPU acceleration paths built-in
5. **Clean API**: Minimal, intuitive public interface

## Decision Points

Throughout the implementation, key decisions are marked with ðŸ›‘ symbols. These require architectural choices that will impact the entire library:

- Swift version requirements
- API design conventions
- Performance targets
- GPU integration approach
- Testing standards

## Architecture Highlights

### Protocol-Based Vector Types
```swift
protocol VectorProtocol {
    associatedtype Storage
    static func makeVector(storage: Storage) -> Self
}
```

### Generic Storage
```swift
struct Storage<D: Dimension> {
    private let aligned: AlignedBuffer
}
```

### ExecutionContext
```swift
protocol ExecutionContext {
    var device: ComputeDevice { get }
    func execute<T>(_ operation: Operation<T>) -> T
}
```

## Success Metrics

- Code reduction: >8% of total codebase
- Performance: No regression from current implementation
- API surface: Reduced by >30%
- Test coverage: >90%
- Documentation: 100% of public API

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Phase 1 Foundation](Phase1_Foundation.md) guide
2. Set up your development environment with the specified tools
3. Create a new branch for the refactoring work
4. Follow each phase sequentially

## Navigation

- Phase 1: [Foundation & Infrastructure](Phase1_Foundation.md)
- Phase 2: [Core Protocol Architecture](Phase2_Protocols.md)
- Phase 3: [Unified Storage System](Phase3_Storage.md)
- Phase 4: [Vector Implementation](Phase4_Vectors.md)
- Phase 5: [Modern Operations Layer](Phase5_Operations.md)

## Notes

- This is a breaking change from any existing code
- No migration guides needed - clean start
- Each phase includes validation steps
- Decisions are tracked in each phase document
